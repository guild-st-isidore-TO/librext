## INSPIRATION

Engravings and printed texts during the first century after Gutenberg's printing press changed Europe and the world. This was a time when the old manuscript production methods were giving way to the next phase of bookmaking. New processes were being explored, but these printmakers still weren't far from the era of scribes writing huge volumes by hand.

LibRext has a particular focus on biblical and liturgical texts, and all their fine details.
