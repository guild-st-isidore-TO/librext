# librext-css

LibRext design system's vanilla CSS stylesheets.

- Generated by Node.js scripts and front-end tools
- main export: vanilla CSS stylesheets
- secondary export: files that fit around the styles (images, fonts, models)

## USAGE

```
npm install

npm run build
```

## VISUAL DESIGN

This style has a heavy focus on old-style serif fonts, as weâ€™re looking to early Renaissance printed works as inspiration. All the fonts here are free/open source, and are available on Google Fonts (and elsewhere on the web)

| TYPEFACES | USAGE |
| --- | --- |
| Crimson Text | Typical serif body, usable as alternate heading |
| Cormorant Garamond | Ideal serif heading |
| Cinzel | Titles, display (serif) |
| Open Sans | Typical sans-serif body |
| Lato | Alternate sans-serif body |
| Inconsolata | Typical monospace |

## SYSTEM DESIGN

- relevant data goes in `src/data-**.json` files
- `npm run build` invokes `src/build.js`, which will update stylesheet files in `css/`
- the specimen `**.html` files should now be styled when viewed

### Open Questions

- what to do with distribution as a package?
