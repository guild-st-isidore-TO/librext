## INSPIRATION

LibRext is inspired primarily by printed texts during the [era of the Incunabula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incunable), the [first century after Gutenberg's press](https://www.britannica.com/topic/incunabula) changed Europe and the world. This was a time when old manuscript production methods were giving way to the next phase of bookmaking. New processes were explored, but printmakers were not far from the era of scribes writing huge manuscripts.

**BELOW**: Valerius Maximus. Mainz: Peter Schöffer, 18. kal. Jul. 1471
